This script is a wrapper around duplicity, with options concerning the
backup of this specific machine.

custom_backup help
custom_backup scheduled
custom_backup restore [options] target
custom_backup verify [options] target
custom_backup collection-status [options]
custom_backup list-current-files [options]
custom_backup cleanup [options]

"help" shows this message. "scheduled" is intended to be run by cron
and performs the scheduled backup. The rest of the commands are
identical to the equivalent duplicity commands; the only difference is
that several options, such as the backup location, gpg options, and so
on, are passed to duplicity anyway and therefore you don't need to
specify them.
